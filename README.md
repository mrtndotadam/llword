This little project was inspired by the times spent looking for web games to play during face-to-face lab classes, and now that I'm on my final year of college, I was hoping this game could reach those who are now in the position I was once in. 

The mechanics of this game is based on a technique that helps in falling asleep (I can vouch for this since this has helped me clear my head during stressful nights). You first think of a random word, then you think of a word that starts with the letter of the previous word, and so on.
