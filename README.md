**LAST LETTER WORD**

This little project was inspired by the times spent looking for web games to play during face-to-face lab classes (don't tell my profs), and now that I'm on my final year of college, I was hoping this game could reach those who are now in the position I was once in (don't tell your profs). 

The mechanics of this game is based on a technique that helps in falling asleep (I can vouch for this since this has helped me clear my head during stressful nights). First think of a random word, then think of a word that starts with the last letter of the previous word, then repeat.

With that said, thanks for stopping by and enjoy this mini game!
